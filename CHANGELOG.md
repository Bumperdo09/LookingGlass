### 1.5.0
Added sorting options to the command menu and scrapper menu. Added equip slot functionality for itemstats.

### 1.4.2
Fixed DPS meter not resetting if you leave while it still has values stored. Fixed transforming into specific mobs like a LesserWisp causing StatsDisplay to break until restart

### 1.4.1
Fixed StatsDisplay not working with RiskUI. Added an option for how many decimal points to be used for floating point values.

### 1.4.0
Fixed a rare bug with CleanHUD. Fixed issue with scrappers and other menu's scaling (as in we don't touch them anymore since it's not needed and makes stuff look wonky and small). Fixed buff timers not showing up all the time. We actually use the setting for item counters now. Probably fixed an issue with Minimap and Refightilization (but it was inconsistent so I'll be on the lookout). Updated StatsDisplay to scale better automatically, also supports manual scaling now (thanks yuukotf2 on github!). Added an option for full item descriptions on pickup (thanks SSM240 on github!). New option to show permanent cooldown numbers for skills too. Added a secondary StatsDisplay string which, when enabled, will be used when the scoreboard is held open.

### 1.3.2
Last update was fake, this one is real a cool, not cringe

### 1.3.1
